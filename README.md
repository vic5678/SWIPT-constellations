# SWIPT-constellations
SWIPT,Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power transfer, systems are used to transmit information and at the same time harvest energy. On the ne hand in order to have a good energy harvesting performance, we need high PAPR-dmin ratio, but on the other we need big dmin to have small Symbol Error Rate, thus a good info transmission performance. In this repository, I will present my work on this subject studying the energy harvesting-infrmation trade off. First, I studied the behavior of the basic constellations PAM, QAM , PSK, then I compare it with CQAM and spike-QAM behavior in terms of PAPR-dmin and SEP performance.
Last but not least, I checked the SEP formulas used for the constellations with monte carlo simulation and I observed there is a mistake in CQAM formula and then doing mathematical computations I found a new formula, confirmed by monte carlo too. This research was conducted at the end , so not all the files are changed, thus in some the incorrect SEP formula is used.
